  "description": "I am often thinking about materials science pedagogy as much as my work on 2D materials and devices as it is a career path I'd like to pursue post graduate school. Particualrly, I am excited about the improvements which can be made towards introductory courses in engineering and science programs as these have an important impact on the career paths of students and whether they pursue an education in a STEM field, particucularly students from underrepresented backgrounds in these fields.",
