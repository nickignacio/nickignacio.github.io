  "description": "PCM devices offer strong scalability and low power consumption for the future of memory storage and computing. However, multistate operation is a key requirement for high density storage or operation in neuromorphic systems. Previous studies on In2Se3 based memory devices report a simple, two state (HRS, LRS) electrical configurationwhich has also been observed in other 2D materials. On the other hand, prelimnary transport measurensts with a 4-probe STM system reveleaed a much more interesting, multi-state switching behavior which covers six orders of magnitude range in device resistance.",
