  "description": "Example problems that can be worked through during class later in the week closer to the quiz. Each of these problems can be given out ahead of time so that students can prepare answers or given class time to discuss with their classmates. Additionally, providing visuals and tables is helpful in answering these questions so student providing answers can illustrate their thought processes by writing their answers on a blackboard. All four questions are comparisons of some sort and so the classroom assessment techniques of misconception/preconception check and approximate analogies can be especially useful in explaining the solutions. Scoring for in-person problem solving can be binary with participation (discussing with other students/providing answers)",
