Recent studies have demonstrated crystalline-crystalline (β → γ) phase transformations of In2Se3 can be used in a PCM device so understanding the behavior in In2Se3 phase transformations is critical to developing low energy In2Se3 memory systems.",

      "description": "The interaction of hydrogen with cobalt metal is of much interest, as it frequently plays a large role in materials science, heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemistry, and energy storage. It is well understood that when a gaseous species adsorbs onto a solid surface, that surface will be altered. This alteration can be electronic, chemical, or physical, and the degree of alteration can be insignificant to substantial. In addition to hydrogen on the surface of a solid, the ability of hydrogen atoms to diffuse through surfaces makes the interaction of a solid with subsurface hydrogen of much importance. Surface as well as subsurface hydrogen can cause changes to the surface of a solid. For any given process, these changes to the surface can be beneficial or detrimental in a small or large way. Understanding the effect an adsorbate as well as subsurface species have on a surface is crucial for understanding and making improvements to important processes.",

However, multistate operation is a key requirement for high density storage or operation in neuromorphic systems. Previous studies on In2Se3 based memory devices report a simple, two state (HRS, LRS) electrical configurationwhich has also been observed in other 2D materials. On the other hand, prelimnary transport measurensts with a 4-probe STM system reveleaed a much more interesting, multi-state switching behavior which covers six orders of magnitude range in device resistance.",

However, materials science remains lacking in diversity in both industry and academia with 26% and 8% of materials engineering positions in the US held by ethnic minorities and women respectively as of 2021 [1]. In academia there is a similar proportion with 40% of materials-science PhDs earned by ethnic minorities and that figure dropping to 3% for African American or Hispanic students [2]. There is a large opportunity to improve this diversity by forming more welcoming department cultures as well as removing additional challenges imposed on women and minority students.  I strive to address these challenges through my interactions with students and service to my engineering department. I believe that a welcoming environment where students are properly supported with easily accessible resources and opportunities available to them and are encouraged to succeed is critical to the wellbeing of students of all backgrounds.",

The pre course survey should be given before the course starts or at the beginning after the syllabus is covered. The pre-course survey will highlight any topics which concern the students or the instructor from the self-reported backgrounds of the student.
