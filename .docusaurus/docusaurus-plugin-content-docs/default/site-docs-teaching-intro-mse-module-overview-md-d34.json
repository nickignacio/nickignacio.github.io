  "description": "Context: This course studies the fundamental principles of chemistry and their applications towards understanding challenges in science and engineering through a materials science and engineering lens. Focus on materials science which builds on the core chemistry concepts emphasized in the earlier half of the course can illuminate the relationship between the microstructure of a material, its processing history, and its resulting properties. Thinking like a materials scientist or engineer will allow us to address the major challenges of our time including climate change and materials design revolution.",
