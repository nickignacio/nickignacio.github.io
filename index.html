                                        <p>After deciding to pursue an engineering career path, I knew I had to pull the plug and work directly on
                                        sustainability. For years, I have been rejected from cleantech positions and learned it's not an easy field to enter.
                                        Exciting, innovative technology startups have a high bar for talent, and I've been told
                                        many times that I would need a PhD. </br></br>
                                        But if I've learned anything over my lifetime, it's that perseverance works wonders. I cold emailed.
                                        I spoke with my professors, friends, and over 20 companies, searching for a small startup, doing impactful work
                                        to further sustainability, where I could learn and grow as an engineer. </br></br>
                                        After a few months of focused effort, I found exactly what I was looking for at Treau, a seed stage startup working on
                                        sustainable building heating and cooling.

                                                Nibble is a marketplace for restaurant food that normally goes to waste. Restaurants throw away
                                                TONS of good food. It's hard to predict demand, so they tend to prepare more food than they can sell.
                                                At the end of the night, the extra food gets tossed. Nibble helps them save money by selling that food
                                                at a discount instead of throwing it away.

                                                I was able to design a small research project studying the effect of different dopants on diffusion paths for nanoparticle catalysts using DFT.
                                                Throughout the summer I was able to develop independent research skills and get some computational research experience in what was my first taste of independent research.

                                        I also realized my previous lack of commitment to an engineering career path stemmed from insecurity in my technical
                                        abilities. These insecurities are rooted in specific instances in my education,
                                        such as failing to finish math tests in the allotted time in middle and high school, getting a B on my high school trig
                                        test, being one of a handful of women in my high school math, physics and engineering classes, doing most poorly on the math
                                        section of standardized tests, and struggling in my math classes at MIT.
                                        </br></br>
                                        These repeated instances of feeling like I was underperforming, coupled with external reinforcement that women aren't as good
                                        at math, have led me to the assumption that 'I am bad at math' and that 'I hate math.' The truth is
                                        that I am far above average in my mathematical thinking, and that I love
                                        and appreciate the way that math allows us to model the world and solve problems. I think a big reason I have 'struggled' in
                                        math has nothing to do with my intelligence, but the arbitrary way in which our education system measures our math abilities.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I have never been <i>fast</i> at math. Therefore, I am bad at taking timed tests. Which our education system uses to
                                        assess our math abilities. I am not fast, because I triple check my work before I trust it. And given enough time, I will
                                        solve almost any problem. If anything, I think that makes me good at math, and well equipped to tackle technical challenges.

Since the focus of the group was to develop materials and processes for radar absorbing/stealth technologies, there was a lot of cool work that I couldn't access due to my security clearence level.
                                        It was still able to learn a lot of from the engineers in my group, and I made my middle school self happy being surrounded by the coolest planes and the engineers that worked on crazy things like the SR-71!
                                        I worked here January and the summer of 2019 and was able to explore much of southern CA's nature with trips to Yosemite (which was my favorite part of the summer)
