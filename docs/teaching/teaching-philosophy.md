# Teaching Philosophy 


Teaching introductory science and engineering courses and mentoring students at MIT and the University of Texas at Austin has illustrated the importance of developing critical thinking for students to not only succeed in their field but also to understand the societal implications of their work. I have learned that to successfully do so, instructors must be able to apply their material to real world examples that are broadly accessible, improve their ability to effectively communicate, and provide a supporting and curious environment.
Thus, the questions I ask myself when preparing for class are the following:
1.	What is the bigger picture question towards which the students can apply this lesson?
2.	How do I expect the students to communicate what theyâ€™ve learned?
3.  Will students be able to view topics from multiple perspectives?
4.	Am I encouraging inclusivity where students feel safe to engage and ask questions?

These four questions help me design teaching strategies and assessments, so my teaching philosophy carries over into the classroom.

My teaching philosophy is based on the Universal Design for Learning framework with a focus on encouraging scientific curiousity and preparation for the real world. My teaching style is most directly influenced by Professors Jeff Grossman and Krishna Kumar who both emphasize an inquisitive and involved approach to learning.
