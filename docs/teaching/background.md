# Teaching Identity

My teaching philosophy is based on the Universal Design for Learning framework with a focus on encouraging scientific curiousity and preparation for the real world. 

### Professional Goals ### 
To teach science and engineering in a university setting. Upon graduation from my Ph.D., I am seeking a teaching focused position at the university level including assistant teaching professor or lecturer positions at R1 universities as well as tenure track positions at a SLAC. My degrees are in materials science and engineering which would be my preference to teach, but my teaching and industry background are multi-disciplinary so I would be happy to teach any positions in STEM including physics, chemistry, and general engineering particularly introductory classes catered towards first year students.

### Short-term Teaching Goals ###
In the first one-five years into my teaching I aim to focus on the following:
1.	Refining teaching practices
2.	Actively serving in my department and college
3.	Design my own course
### Long-term Teaching Goals ### 
In the first one-five years into my teaching I aim to focus on the following:
1.	Conduct engineering education research 
2.	Become a leading teaching in the university
3.	Establish industry partnerships
