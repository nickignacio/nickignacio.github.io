# Module Overview

Context: This course studies the fundamental principles of chemistry and their applications towards understanding challenges in science and engineering through a materials science and engineering lens. Focus on materials science which builds on the core chemistry concepts emphasized in the earlier half of the course can illuminate the relationship between the microstructure of a material, its processing history, and its resulting properties. Thinking like a materials scientist or engineer will allow us to address the major challenges of our time including climate change and materials design revolution.

The targeted audience for this course is first or second-year undergraduate students. Chemistry background is not required. The format of the class will be lecture based without a lab component. The focus of the course is introducing chemistry in a problem-solving context. Material for the course will be adapted from MIT 3.091, Introduction to Solid State Chemistry, and Callister's Materials Science and Engineering.

#### _Where in the course might this module be presented?_ 
This module can be presented near middle-to-end of the course once standard introductory chemistry content is covered up to molecular orbital theory. Crystallography is the primary prerequisite knowledge for this module so as long as that content is covered in a prior module then this module can be presented. For example, this can be presented in an introductory materials science and engineering course fairly early in the course.

#### _Are there common preconceptions or particular topics which may give students trouble?_ 
Students may relate grain boundaries to less desirable mechanical properties. A key learning objective is understanding the impact of grain boundaries so remind students to take a step back and consider the motion of dislocations upon reaching grain boundaries. The carpet demonstration is a good teaching method for this point.

#### _Does this have to be presented in a flipped-classroom format?_
 No, this course can easily be adapted to a traditional lecture course as seen in 3.091. However, dedicated problem solving sessions are strongly suggested.
