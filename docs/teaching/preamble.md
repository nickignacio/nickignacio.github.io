# Teaching Portofolio Preamble

This preamble is intended to give context to the content provided in this teaching portfolio

## What's include in this teaching portfolio?
This teaching portfolio is intended to (1) provide my (Nick Ignacio's) philosophy on teaching and (2) serve as an snapshot of how I would instruct with example teaching modules from self-designed courses on introductory materials science and engineering and nanomaterial characterization. Within it, I have included: 
* a summaries of my teaching and diversity statements
* example teaching modules for the aforementioned courses including example:
    * module overviews with learning obejectives
    * syllabus
    * assessment instruments 
    * learning examples
* a documentation of teaching
* summary presentation of my teaching portfolio with teaching example

This portfolio is by no means exhaustive in regards to the content of the course, rather, provides an onverivew of my plans, philosophies and means for execution. I will also treat this as a living document updating teaching examples and my statements as I gain more experiences. All material is available upon request.
