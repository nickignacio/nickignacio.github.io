### Selected Feedback

>Nicholas was super nice and friendly. He presented the subject matter in a way that was digestible and engaging, especially when I didn't understand the basic concepts.

>He was very approachable and explained things in a sense that made more sense to me. He would also explain things different ways if I wasn't fully comprehending it.

>The most helpful interactions were when he would take the time to provide real-world comparisons to make the concepts easier to grasp.

>I appreciated his openness to questions and flexibility based on what students were needing. He taught concepts clearly and was more than happy to slow down when things did not make sense.

### Outreach Experience

`02/2022-current` K-12 STEM outreach through UT MRSEC in local elementary schools with science demonstrations and activities at elementary-middle school STEM clubs and UT outreach fairs

`08/2021-current` MIT Education Councilor (interview prospective undergraduates)

`08/2018-08/2021` Dept. of Materials Science Freshman Pre-orientation prgram mentor and coordinator, weeklong program introducing incoming-first year students at MIT to materials science and engineering and the opportunities available to them through the department of materials science and engineering.

## Professional Goals ##
To teach science and engineering in a university setting. Upon graduation from my Ph.D., I am seeking a teaching focused position at the university level including assistant teaching professor or lecturer positions at R1 universities as well as tenure track positions at a SLAC. My degrees are in materials science and engineering which would be my preference to teach, but my teaching and industry background are multi-disciplinary so I would be happy to teach any positions in STEM including physics, chemistry, and general engineering particularly introductory classes catered towards first year students.

### Short-term Teaching Goals ###
In the first one-five years into my teaching I aim to focus on the following:
1.	Refining teaching practices
2.	Actively serving in my department and college
3.	Design my own course
### Long-term Teaching Goals ### 
In the first one-five years into my teaching I aim to focus on the following:
1.	Conduct engineering education research 
2.	Become a leading teaching in the university
3.	Establish industry partnerships
