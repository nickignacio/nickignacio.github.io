## Selected Feedback

>Nicholas was super nice and friendly. He presented the subject matter in a way that was digestible and engaging, especially when I didn't understand the basic concepts.

>He was very approachable and explained things in a sense that made more sense to me. He would also explain things different ways if I wasn't fully comprehending it.

>The most helpful interactions were when he would take the time to provide real-world comparisons to make the concepts easier to grasp.

>I appreciated his openness to questions and flexibility based on what students were needing. He taught concepts clearly and was more than happy to slow down when things did not make sense.
