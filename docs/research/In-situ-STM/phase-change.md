# Tip Induced Phase Changes

Similar to how STM can be used to create or erase defects_CITETHIS_ with the surface before and after visuallized with atomic resolution, I am investigating the use of the STM tip to trigger local phase changes on notable phase change material, In2Se3, with applied voltage pulses. 

While Joule heating is the conventional mechanism for the phase changes at the nanoscale as it is in macroscale devices, some promising phase change materials also require an additional incentive to transition phases. For the case of In2Se3, it is an transverse electric field of sufficient strength which is hypothesized to unlock a key reveresible phase transition at the 2D scale.
