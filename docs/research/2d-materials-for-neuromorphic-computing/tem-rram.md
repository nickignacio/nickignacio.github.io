# TEM Studies of Memristors

TEM is a powerful tool to image atoms and nanoscale phenomena at high spatial reosultion where are key parameters in devices with switching layers only a few atoms thick. Throughout my PhD work, I collaborate with other researchers more focused on synthesis of 2D materials or novel 2D/1D device architectures to directly image the key interfaces of the 2D materials. I am also combinig this approach with my investigation of layer-by-layer phase change mememories.
