# Defect Engineering for Reliability

2D memristors have demonstrated attractive resistive switching characteristics recently but also suffer from the reliability issue, which limits practical applications. Previous efforts on 2D memristors have primarily focused on exploring new material systems, while damage from the metallization step remains a practical concern for the reliability of 2D memristors.

I work towards the defect engineering of 2D materials to improve reliability and eventual integration of 2D materials into the CMOS production line primarly as a microscopist. Utilizing atomic resolution imaging I can inform the materials synthesists and device fabricators of the defects existing in their results allows for more informed device production with the goal of practical applications in mind.
