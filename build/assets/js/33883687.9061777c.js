I looked to investigate the interaction between hydrogen and cobalt metal which is used as a catalyst for FTS in the form of nanoparticles. Specifically, we investigated the hydrogen and its evolution to subsurface hydrogen as atomic hydrogen has a low barrier to diffusion below the surface of transition metals. Using the STM to monitor the surface of a model polycrystalline cobalt surface, hydrogen exposures including excited atomic hydrogen were conducted. We are looking to answer questions on the effect of coverage, temperature, and species on the devleopment of hydrogen through the evolution of the cobalt surface."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>i});var a=o(6540);const s={},n=a.createContext(s);function r(e){const t=a.useContext(n);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:r(e.components),a.createElement(n.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
