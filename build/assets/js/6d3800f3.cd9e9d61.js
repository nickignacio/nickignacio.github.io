However, it is estimated that the increase in temperature when a voltage is applied between the tip and the surface is not enough to reach the transformation temperature. Identifying the driving force behind the phase transformation will be essential for In2Se3 PCM device design. In single-crystal monolayers of In2Se3 the crystalline-crystalline phase change from \u03b1\u2192 \u03b2 can be explicitly determined by measuring differences in the electrical resistivity before and after a voltage from the STM tip is applied. Extracting information on the phase transformation of In2Se3 in monolayers can be extended to further our knowledge of the scaling behavior of the phase transformations and associated changes of the electrical properties. With this proposal we want to investigate the use an STM tip to drive a solid-solid phase transition in which monolayer \u03b1 In2Se3 is transformed locally to nanometer-scale domains of \u03b2 phase In2Se3.The driving force of the phase transitions, and the impact of defects on the transition will be investigated. Locally and selectively engineering phase transitions in these monolayer systems will allow for the improvement of In2Se3 PCM devices."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>o});var i=n(6540);const r={},a=i.createContext(r);function s(e){const t=i.useContext(a);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function o(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:s(e.components),i.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
