Recent studies have demonstrated crystalline-crystalline (\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b3) phase transformations of In2Se3 can be used in a PCM device so understanding the behavior in In2Se3 phase transformations is critical to developing low energy In2Se3 memory systems.","sidebar":"research"},"research/2d-materials-for-neuromorphic-computing/defect-eng":{"id":"research/2d-materials-for-neuromorphic-computing/defect-eng","title":"Defect Engineering for Reliability","description":"2D memristors have demonstrated attractive resistive switching characteristics recently but also suffer from the reliability issue, which limits practical applications. Previous efforts on 2D memristors have primarily focused on exploring new material systems, while damage from the metallization step remains a practical concern for the reliability of 2D memristors.","sidebar":"research"},"research/2d-materials-for-neuromorphic-computing/tem-rram":{"id":"research/2d-materials-for-neuromorphic-computing/tem-rram","title":"TEM Studies of Memristors","description":"TEM is a powerful tool to image atoms and nanoscale phenomena at high spatial reosultion where are key parameters in devices with switching layers only a few atoms thick. Throughout my PhD work, I collaborate with other researchers more focused on synthesis of 2D materials or novel 2D/1D device architectures to directly image the key interfaces of the 2D materials. I am also combinig this approach with my investigation of layer-by-layer phase change mememories.","sidebar":"research"},"research/In-situ-STM/co-reconstruction":{"id":"research/In-situ-STM/co-reconstruction","title":"Co Reconstruction by H Exposure","description":"The interaction of hydrogen with cobalt metal is of much interest, as it frequently plays a large role in materials science, heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemistry, and energy storage. It is well understood that when a gaseous species adsorbs onto a solid surface, that surface will be altered. This alteration can be electronic, chemical, or physical, and the degree of alteration can be insignificant to substantial. In addition to hydrogen on the surface of a solid, the ability of hydrogen atoms to diffuse through surfaces makes the interaction of a solid with subsurface hydrogen of much importance. Surface as well as subsurface hydrogen can cause changes to the surface of a solid. For any given process, these changes to the surface can be beneficial or detrimental in a small or large way. Understanding the effect an adsorbate as well as subsurface species have on a surface is crucial for understanding and making improvements to important processes.","sidebar":"research"},"research/In-situ-STM/layer-by-layer":{"id":"research/In-situ-STM/layer-by-layer","title":"Layer-by-Layer Phase Changes","description":"PCM devices offer strong scalability and low power consumption for the future of memory storage and computing. However, multistate operation is a key requirement for high density storage or operation in neuromorphic systems. Previous studies on In2Se3 based memory devices report a simple, two state (HRS, LRS) electrical configurationwhich has also been observed in other 2D materials. On the other hand, prelimnary transport measurensts with a 4-probe STM system reveleaed a much more interesting, multi-state switching behavior which covers six orders of magnitude range in device resistance.","sidebar":"research"},"research/In-situ-STM/memristor-effect":{"id":"research/In-situ-STM/memristor-effect","title":"Memristor effect in 2D materials","description":"STM is a powerful characterization techinque providing imaging at atomic resolution as well as equally precise probing tool.

Additionally, introduction materials science courses are often in mechanical or chemical engineering departments so the backgrounds of the students will vary and may not meet the prerequisites. The pre course survey should be given before the course starts or at the beginning after the syllabus is covered. The pre-course survey will highlight any topics which concern the students or the instructor from the self-reported backgrounds of the student. The results from this assessment should inform the instructor where more attention should be paid in specific topics/lectures or if supplementary lectures are needed.","sidebar":"teaching"},"teaching/introMSE/learning_activities":{"id":"teaching/introMSE/learning_activities","title":"Learning Activities","description":"Example problems that can be worked through during class later in the week closer to the quiz. Each of these problems can be given out ahead of time so that students can prepare answers or given class time to discuss with their classmates. Additionally, providing visuals and tables is helpful in answering these questions so student providing answers can illustrate their thought processes by writing their answers on a blackboard. All four questions are comparisons of some sort and so the classroom assessment techniques of misconception/preconception check and approximate analogies can be especially useful in explaining the solutions. Scoring for in-person problem solving can be binary with participation (discussing with other students/providing answers)","sidebar":"teaching"},"teaching/introMSE/module_overview":{"id":"teaching/introMSE/module_overview","title":"Module Overview","description":"Context: This course studies the fundamental principles of chemistry and their applications towards understanding challenges in science and engineering through a materials science and engineering lens. Focus on materials science which builds on the core chemistry concepts emphasized in the earlier half of the course can illuminate the relationship between the microstructure of a material, its processing history, and its resulting properties. Thinking like a materials scientist or engineer will allow us to address the major challenges of our time including climate change and materials design revolution.","sidebar":"teaching"},"teaching/teaching-experience":{"id":"teaching/teaching-experience","title":"Teaching Experience","description":"University Experience","sidebar":"teaching"},"teaching/teaching-philosophy":{"id":"teaching/teaching-philosophy","title":"Teaching Philosophy","description":"For a more detailed and formal statement of my teaching philosophy, please reach out to me.","sidebar":"teaching"}}}}')}}]);
