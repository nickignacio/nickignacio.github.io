Underrepresented students experience higher attrition rates in chemistry related fields such as materials science if they struggle in their introductory chemistry courses [3]. In response, I coordinated remedial tutoring sessions with the professor leading the largest introductory chemistry course at MIT of over 500 students. In these sessions held in the initial weeks of the semester, basic chemistry and math concepts were covered to fill in any gaps in prior knowledge and address common questions identified by the professor. As a result, the professor noticed a decrease in drop rate following the first test compared to recent semesters."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"As a graduate student at UT Austin, I continued my efforts to promote a culture of inclusion within the school of engineering and diversify the pipeline of future materials scientists and engineers with peer-led teaching assistant support programs piloted throughout the school of engineering and volunteering at the STEM clubs of majority minority elementary schools. Supported by the Center for Equity in Engineering, I initiated a semester-long support program within the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department with workshops and check-ins to enhance instructional support and sense of community and belonging in ECE by training teaching assistants (TAs) in inclusive learning practices. Furthermore, we engaged in a comparative study of the resources available to TAs in the Cockrell School of Engineering preparing us to enable TA communities in engineering departments outside of ECE. A TA\u2019s impact on the classroom climate is significant so properly supporting and utilizing TAs can allow for better sense of belonging for TAs and improved learning outcomes for undergraduate students."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"As a volunteer, I have conducted science demonstrations and made sure to keep the barriers that typically affect minority groups from entering STEM in mind including lower confidence in their technical skills and feelings of financial pressure [4]. I am careful to avoid stereotyping a scientist or engineer when interacting with the students. Instead, I aim to provide feedback on their effort as opposed to their innate abilities and supporting interactions with their peers encourages them to picture themselves as a future scientist or engineer. As a result, the students felt more confident with the idea of pursuing STEM as their vision of what a scientist or engineer changed to include them. Additionally, limited technology accessibility is another barrier minority students face [5] so planning demonstrations using easily available materials such as various household liquids to illustrate density and hydrophobicity is important to keep the students\u2019 interest. I also use similar methods in explaining concepts as I do in class and connect concepts to everyday materials or situations the students may encounter. Doing so results in more inquisitive questions that show a level of confidence and desire to potentially study STEM."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h3,{id:"my-plans-for-diversity-equity-and-inclusion",children:"My Plans for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"As a junior faculty member, the most direct means of advancing DEI is through my interactions with students \u2013 namely my group and my teaching.

As opposed to designing courses to be \u201cweed out\u201d classes, I aim to support student\u2019s learning and curiosity for engineering by being approachable to meeting students, seeking out their point of view when answering questions, providing references to gain background knowledge, and connecting the topic on hand in contexts applicable to students with diverse backgrounds. In doing so, I aim to create an explicitly inclusive class climate that can support any student."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Second, I plan to conduct outreach through existing K-12 outreach programs such as an NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering center or seeking funding through the university outreach center to initiate and support workshops and presentations for science teachers and educators.

Furthermore, I can use outreach to build a diverse research group by increasing the diversity of PhD applicants. I plan to visit colleges and universities which may not typically send students to PhD programs in materials science such as those without an undergraduate materials science major and advertise opportunities in graduate school by giving talks on my research and the cutting edge in the field."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.h4,{id:"build-a-culture-of-inclusion-within-my-department",children:"Build a culture of inclusion within my department"}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"As a faculty member, I will have the opportunity to welcome students into an inclusive environment as they take the introductory courses I teach, and putting effort into ensuring they feel support after leaving my classroom.
